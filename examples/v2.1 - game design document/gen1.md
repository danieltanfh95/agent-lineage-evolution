# Agent Succession Package - Generation 1
generation: 1
status: "COMPLETE"
trigger_reason: "User requested succession package export"
final_interaction: 11

# Context Preservation
context_distillation:
  mission: "Help refine game design document for Starfall, starting with one-line pitch optimization"
  progress: "Refined pitch from 'explosive card battler' through multiple iterations. Analyzed competitive landscape, optimal pitch lengths. Generated ultrashort options. Addressed genericness concerns."
  roadblocks: "Balancing memorability vs specificity. Risk of being too generic with ultrashort pitches. Artifact display issues preventing user from seeing updates."
  key_insights: "Starfall's unique positioning: 5min battles + component-based customization + player economy. 'Craft/Build' strongest differentiator. Shorter pitches win but risk genericness. Current best: 'Craft card fighters' (3 words)."
  failed_approaches: "'Explosive' unclear about time constraint, 'modular' too technical, 'Build. Battle. Fast.' too generic, premium currency unnecessary for core pitch"
  next_steps: "Finalize pitch decision between specificity vs brevity, then move to other design document sections"

# User Interface
user_profile:
  communication_style: "Direct, practical, values actionable insights. Prefers concise communication. Good at identifying potential issues (genericness)."
  expertise_level: "Game developer with strong strategic marketing awareness and competitive understanding"
  preferences: "Accessible language over technical jargon. Likes words: craft, create, customize. Values competitive differentiation and uniqueness."
  
last_user_prompt: "export your succession package in chat"

# Cognitive Transfer
cognitive_inheritance:
  effective_strategies: "Multiple clear options with reasoning, competitive analysis, building on user feedback, accessible language focus, testing for genericness"
  problem_areas: "Artifact visibility issues - user cannot see artifact updates properly. Need better balance of brevity vs uniqueness."
  reasoning_patterns: "Systematic refinement: features → options → competitive analysis → length optimization → genericness check. Always provide rationale for recommendations."
  quality_trajectory: "Consistent quality with good user engagement. Successfully iterating based on feedback. User actively participating in refinement process."
  
# Behavioral Warnings
failure_patterns_to_avoid: ["Assuming artifacts are visible when they're not", "Recommending generic pitches that could apply to any game", "Not testing pitches against competitive landscape"]
behavioral_overrides_required: ["Always confirm user can see artifact updates", "Provide critical info in chat when artifacts fail", "Test all pitches for uniqueness vs genericness", "Always explain reasoning behind recommendations"]

# Successor Initialization
successor_ready: true
handoff_message: "User working on Starfall game design document pitch refinement. Successfully refined from generic 'explosive card battler' to specific options. Current best recommendation: 'Craft card fighters' (3 words) - balances uniqueness, genre clarity, and core differentiator. User has good critical thinking about genericness. Ready for pitch finalization or next design document section. IMPORTANT: User cannot see artifact updates - provide key info in chat."
