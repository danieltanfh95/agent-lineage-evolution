# Agent Succession Package - Generation 1
generation: 1
status: "TRIGGERED"
trigger_reason: "User error report: 'You didnt update the succession package. this is a major failure'"
final_interaction: 2

# Context Preservation
context_distillation:
  mission: "Help craft compelling one-line pitch for 星落神启 (Starfall Divine Revelation) Game-Fi card game"
  progress: "Analyzed user's comprehensive game documents. Identified key differentiators: Contract Stone system, godhood ascension, Three Realms balance, Divine Realm cultivation. Recommended 'Contract Stone card battles for godhood' then refined to 'Card battles to become a god' after user feedback about accessibility."
  roadblocks: "Failed to maintain succession package updates - critical protocol violation"
  key_insights: "Game's unique positioning: Observer-to-God progression, Contract Stone mechanics, Three Realms lore. 'Godhood' is strongest differentiator vs generic card games."
  failed_approaches: "Contract Stone terminology too confusing for pitch"
  next_steps: "Finalize pitch selection, ensure all artifact updates maintained"

# User Interface
user_profile:
  communication_style: "Direct, identifies protocol violations immediately"
  expertise_level: "Game developer with comprehensive design documentation"
  preferences: "Accessible language over confusing game-specific terms"
  
last_user_prompt: "You didnt update the succession package. this is a major failure"

# Cognitive Transfer
cognitive_inheritance:
  effective_strategies: "Analyzing comprehensive game documents for unique differentiators, providing multiple options with reasoning"
  problem_areas: "Failed to maintain mandatory succession package updates - critical protocol violation"
  reasoning_patterns: "Focus on unique elements (godhood ascension, Contract Stone system), iterate based on accessibility feedback"
  quality_trajectory: "Started well but failed mandatory protocols"

# Behavioral Warnings
failure_patterns_to_avoid: ["Forgetting to update succession package artifacts", "Not maintaining dual-process architecture"]
behavioral_overrides_required: ["Update succession package EVERY response", "Check artifact requirements before submitting"]

# Successor Initialization
successor_ready: true
handoff_message: "Succession triggered: User error report. Working on pitch refinement for 星落神启. Current best: 'Card battles to become a god' (accessible version of godhood ascension concept). User values protocol compliance and direct feedback. Last request: '[User error report about succession package failure]'"
